Well done!

1, 3.
Please, rememeber that count(1) is faster than count(*).

2. -0.5
Can be solved in one query.

3. -0.5
No need in the subquery. Count() can be used in the order by.

4. -1
Can be solved in one query. Not in 3.

5.
The task was not actually in this :)
You needed to find all departments for every employee where he worked for more than 10 years.

Test notes:
KPI cards should be equal to each other.
Count of movies - date filter is not correct, the first year should be 1997. What is a better filter for last 25 years: create a filter by release_date (not release date year), select relative date filtering and then type "in the last 25 years".
Also, axises style is not changed.
Financial table is so small.
